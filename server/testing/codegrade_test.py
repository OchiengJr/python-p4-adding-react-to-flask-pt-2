def test_codegrade_placeholder():
    """Codegrade placeholder test"""
    assert 1 == 1  # Basic assertion, checks if 1 equals 1 (always true)

    # Example of a more meaningful assertion:
    # Assuming you have a function `calculate_sum` that sums two numbers
    result = calculate_sum(2, 3)
    assert result == 5, "Expected the sum of 2 and 3 to be 5"

    # Example of parameterized testing with pytest:
    params = [
        (1, 1, 2),  # (input1, input2, expected_output)
        (0, 0, 0),
        (-1, 1, 0),
    ]
    for a, b, expected in params:
        assert calculate_sum(a, b) == expected, f"Failed for inputs: {a}, {b}"

    # Example of mocking with pytest-mock (assuming `mocked_db_function` exists):
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        mocked_db_function()  # Mocked function raises ValueError, assert behavior

    # Add more assertions as needed to cover different scenarios

    # If no assertions fail, the test passes
